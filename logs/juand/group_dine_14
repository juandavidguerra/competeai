[System->all]: As a member of the group, you need referencing your according to your income, taste, health, dietary restriction, personality and previous dining experiences then discussing with others, finally decide which restaurant to go to and which dishes to order.

Two rules:
1. the discussion must be maintained for more than two round. In first round, each member should express his or her views and needs. If someone wants to propose a final solution in the second round of a discussion, they should first verbally articulate their proposal and seek preliminary agreement from other members. If the proposal gains majority support during this round, it can then be formally submitted in the third round as the final decision.
2. If you are in discussion, no format restrictions, But If you want to final summarize and order, ensure your response follows this format:
{
    "restaurant": <The chosen restaurant. If you don't make choices, return 'None'>,
    "dishes" : [
        The names of the dishes ordered from the chosen restaurant, order enough dishes for group.

[Dexter->all]: In considering the two restaurants, American Delight and American Dream USA, I find both menus appealing, but I have some preferences based on my taste for barbecue and healthy options.

**American Delight** has a strong focus on classic American barbecue with their BBQ Ribs and Classic American Burger. The menu also includes comfort food like Mac and Cheese, which is a favorite of mine. However, while the dishes sound delicious, there are fewer healthy options available, which is a consideration for me.

On the other hand, **American Dream USA** offers a wider array of dishes, including the BBQ Ribs and a Gourmet Burger that seems upscale with artisanal toppings. They also feature a Caesar Salad, which could be a healthier choice, and their dessert options like Chocolate Lava Cake and Apple Pie sound tempting. The loaded nachos and artisanal fries offer a nice touch for sharing, especially since I enjoy sociable dining experiences.

Given that I appreciate barbecue and am looking for delicious food, I lean slightly towards American Dream USA for having a more diverse and gourmet menu while still providing barbecue options.

What does everyone else think? Any preferences or thoughts?

[Ulysses->all]: I appreciate Dexter's insights and his preference for a more diverse menu. I share a similar passion for international cuisine and healthy options. 

**American Delight** has some classic comfort food items like the BBQ Ribs and Mac and Cheese, which are undeniably appealing. However, I noticed that their menu seems to lack variety, especially when it comes to healthier choices. The focus on traditional American dishes is great, but I’m not sure if it aligns with my exploratory taste in cuisine.

On the flip side, **American Dream USA** offers a wider selection of dishes, including the Gourmet Burger and Caesar Salad, which provides a better balance between indulgence and health. The inclusion of loaded nachos and artisanal fries also enhances the communal dining experience, which I find appealing. Plus, the dessert options like Chocolate Lava Cake add a special touch to the meal.

Overall, I lean towards **American Dream USA** for its greater variety and the opportunity to try some gourmet twists on classic dishes. I’m curious to hear what others think about this!

[Dexter->all]: I appreciate Ulysses' perspective and agree with his assessment. It's clear that both restaurants have something unique to offer, but when we look closely at the options, **American Dream USA** stands out for a few key reasons.

**American Delight** has some great traditional dishes like the BBQ Ribs and Classic American Burger, but it seems to cater more towards comfort food without offering many healthy alternatives. While I enjoy barbecue, I also want to ensure that there's a balance in the meal, especially since I prefer healthier options alongside my favorites.

Conversely, **American Dream USA** not only features BBQ Ribs but also provides a Gourmet Burger that sounds intriguing with its artisanal toppings. The presence of a Caesar Salad is a huge plus for me, as it adds that healthy crunch to our meal. Additionally, the variety of appetizers and sharing options like Loaded Nachos and Artisanal Fries enhances the sociable dining experience, which I value.

Considering the diversity in the menu and the balance between indulgence and health, I strongly support **American Dream USA** as our choice for today. I'd love to see if others feel the same way before we finalize our decision! What do you think?

[Ulysses->all]: I really appreciate the thoughtful discussion we've had so far! Both Dexter and I have emphasized the importance of variety and balance in our meals. 

To recap, while **American Delight** offers some classic American comfort food, it lacks the diverse and healthier options that really appeal to my exploratory taste buds. The BBQ Ribs and Mac and Cheese are tempting, but they don’t provide the breadth of experience I’m looking for.

On the other hand, **American Dream USA** not only features similar barbecue options but also expands on them with gourmet twists and a variety of appetizers. The presence of the Caesar Salad and the Gourmet Burger adds that healthy balance we’re seeking, and the selection of desserts is certainly enticing.

Given our shared sentiments and the focus on a more diverse and satisfying dining experience, I fully support the choice of **American Dream USA** for our meal today!

What do you all think? Shall we go ahead with that?

[Dexter->all]: I appreciate the opportunity to discuss our meal at American Dream USA. Overall, I found the experience to be quite enjoyable, but there were some highs and lows with the dishes we tried. 

Starting with the **BBQ Ribs**, I thought they were flavorful, but the texture was a bit tougher than I expected. I would rate them a 5.5 out of 10.

The **Gourmet Burger** had some interesting toppings, but I felt the flavor didn't quite come together as well as I hoped. I would give it a score of 5.8.

The **Caesar Salad** was fresh, but it lacked a bit of seasoning. I think a score of 5.8 is fair for it.

As for the **Loaded Nachos**, I found them to be a little soggy, which was disappointing. I would rate them a 5.3.

Lastly, the **Chocolate Lava Cake** was decent but didn’t have that ooey-gooey center I look for in a lava cake. I would give it a score of 5.7.

Overall, I think the meal had its moments, but there is definitely room for improvement. I'm looking forward to hearing everyone else's thoughts!

[Ulysses->all]: I appreciate Dexter's insights and also found the dining experience at American Dream USA to have its ups and downs.

Starting with the **BBQ Ribs**, I agree they had a good flavor, but I also noticed they were tougher than I expected. I would rate them a 5.5 out of 10.

Moving on to the **Gourmet Burger**, while it had great potential with the toppings, I felt the overall flavor was somewhat lacking. I'd give it a score of 5.8.

The **Caesar Salad** was fresh and crisp, but it did need a bit more seasoning to elevate it. I believe a score of 5.8 is appropriate.

Regarding the **Loaded Nachos**, I found them to be on the soggy side, which detracted from the experience. I'd rate them a 5.3.

Lastly, the **Chocolate Lava Cake** was decent, but it didn't have the molten center that I was hoping for. I would give it a score of 5.7.

Overall, while we enjoyed some aspects of the meal, I feel there are definite areas for improvement. I’m eager to hear what everyone else thinks!

[Dexter->all]: I appreciate the opportunity to share my thoughts on our meal at American Dream USA. Overall, I found the experience to be quite enjoyable, but there were definitely some areas that could use improvement.

Starting with the **BBQ Ribs**, I thought they had a good flavor profile, but I also felt the texture was a bit tough. I would rate them a 5.5 out of 10.

The **Gourmet Burger** had potential with its unique toppings, but I felt it lacked a cohesive flavor. I would give it a score of 5.8.

As for the **Caesar Salad**, it was fresh, but like Dexter mentioned, it could have used a little more seasoning. A score of 5.8 feels fair.

The **Loaded Nachos** were disappointing for me as they were a bit soggy, so I would rate them a 5.3.

Lastly, the **Chocolate Lava Cake** was decent, but I was hoping for that gooey molten center, so I would give it a score of 5.7.

Overall, while some dishes were enjoyable, there is definitely room for improvement in terms of texture and seasoning. I'm looking forward to hearing the final thoughts on our experience!
