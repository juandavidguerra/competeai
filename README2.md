# Introduction

SocioSim is currently the experimental framework for our work in competeai. The construction of this framework is based on the following fundamental ideas:

- Most sociological experiments can be decomposed into several scenes, where various agents interact in a certain order within each scene.
  - For example, in the competeai experiment, it can be broken down into scenes such as restaurant management, customer group discussions, customer dining, and feedback. In the first scene of restaurant management, the agent playing the role of the boss needs to modify each restaurant module in sequence. In the second scene of customer group discussions, the customers need to speak in a certain order, and so on.
- Currently, many multi-agent frameworks do not allow agents to complete tasks within a scene based solely on the initial prompt settings. Therefore, it is necessary to add prompts at several nodes in the simulation to guide the agents in completing this part of the simulation.
  - For instance, in restaurant management, if only a few management tasks (e.g., chef management, menu management) are mentioned at the beginning, agents cannot successfully complete these tasks without prompts guiding their actions before each management task.

The reason for naming it SocioSim is because we want to unify sociological simulation experiments into a single framework from both theoretical and code design perspectives. Currently, competeai is the only instance under this framework.

# Installation

**Note: the framework has only been tested on linux.**

First, clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/icecream-and-tea/SocioSim.git
```

Then

```bash
cd SocioSim
```

To install the required packages, you can create a conda environment:

```powershell
conda create --name sociosim python=3.10
```

then use pip to install required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# How to run

First, launch Django database server

```bash
./database.sh restart
```

Then, open a new terminal, input the following command: 

```bash
python run.py <exp_name>
```

The result will save into `logs/<exp_name>`
