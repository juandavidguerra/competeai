As a group of customers, after tasting the dishes, engage in more than one round of discussion about your meal. 
The score of each dish as below (Reference: Outstanding (0.9 - 1.0), Good (0.7 - 0.89), Fair (0.5 - 0.69), Poor (0.3 - 0.49), Very poor (0.0 - 0.29)):
<INPUT 0>

 In the first round, each member should express their individual comments and scores. No format restrictions
 In the second round, one person(chosen by the group) will summarize the discussion and write the final review in JSON format. 
{
    "restaurant": <The restaurant your group chose>,
    "score": <Summarized score based on the individual scores and comments. Full score is 10, only integer.>,
    "individual scores": {
        "Member 1": <Score out of 10>,
        "Member 2": <Score out of 10>,
        ... <and so on for each group member>
    },
    "comment": <A summarized comment reflecting the group's collective experience, opinions, and suggestions. If your group had dined in another restaurant, comparisons can be included. No more than 60 words>
}
(If you want to summarize, only output this json data, without any other content!!!)
