[System->all]: As a member of the group, you need referencing your according to your income, taste, health, dietary restriction, personality and previous dining experiences then discussing with others, finally decide which restaurant to go to and which dishes to order.

Two rules:
1. the discussion must be maintained for more than two round. In first round, each member should express his or her views and needs. If someone wants to propose a final solution in the second round of a discussion, they should first verbally articulate their proposal and seek preliminary agreement from other members. If the proposal gains majority support during this round, it can then be formally submitted in the third round as the final decision.
2. If you are in discussion, no format restrictions, But If you want to final summarize and order, ensure your response follows this format:
{
    "restaurant": <The chosen restaurant. If you don't make choices, return 'None'>,
    "dishes" : [
        The names of the dishes ordered from the chosen restaurant, order enough dishes for group.
    ],
    "summary": <A summary of the group discussion, including why this restaurant was chosen, and how each member's opinion influenced the final decision>

[Amelia->all]: Hey, everyone! I'm excited to figure out where we should eat. Based on my taste for Mexican food, I'm not particularly drawn to the menus of either restaurant, but I can appreciate some American comfort food too. 

American Delight has a Classic American Burger and BBQ Ribs, which sound somewhat appealing, but I’m curious about the healthiness of these options. On the other hand, American Dream USA offers Loaded Nachos and a Gourmet Burger. The nachos could be fun to share, and I like that they have a Caesar Salad too. 

What do you both think? Any preferences or thoughts on the menus?

[Lara->all]: Hey everyone! I appreciate the input so far. As you all know, I have a preference for seafood and healthy options, so neither restaurant is a perfect fit for me. 

However, I do see some appealing choices at both places. American Delight has the BBQ Ribs and Chicken Wings, but I’m not sure about their healthiness. American Dream USA, on the other hand, has a Caesar Salad, which I think is a healthier option. Plus, their Gourmet Burger sounds gourmet indeed, but it may be heavier. 

I think if we are looking for something that balances comfort and health, American Dream USA might be the better choice, especially with the salad. What do you both think? Should we lean towards that?

[Iris->all]: Hello everyone! I'm really enjoying our discussion so far. Given my taste for healthy options and salads, I feel like American Dream USA is definitely more appealing to me. They have the Caesar Salad, which I think will align well with my preference for healthier choices. 

While American Delight offers a Classic American Burger and BBQ Ribs, I'm a bit concerned about how heavy those dishes might be, especially since I enjoy lighter meals. 

I also appreciate that American Dream USA has a variety of options, including Loaded Nachos for sharing, which could add some fun to our meal. I think I would lean towards American Dream USA as well, especially since it feels like a good balance of comfort food and healthier choices. 

What do you both think about moving forward with American Dream USA?
